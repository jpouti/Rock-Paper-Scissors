# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Part of The Odin Project Foundation course.

[The project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors#introduction) is about to make a simple implementation of classic game "rock paper scissors".

For the start the game is meant to be played from the browser console, but will be updated later on the course with a basic Graphical User Interface.
